;; This library contains many extra functions & commands for dealing with org-tables which are documented below.
;; For more information see the Readme.org file: https://github.com/vapniks/org-table-jb-extras/tree/main
;; 
;;;;;;;;

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below is a complete list of commands:
;;
;;  `org-table-insert-or-delete-vline'
;;    Insert a vertical line in the current column, or delete some if NDELETE is non-nil.
;;  `org-table-grab-columns'
;;    Copy/kill columns or region of table and return as list(s).
;;  `org-table-flatten-columns'
;;    Apply FN to next NROWS cells in selected columns and replace cells in current row with results.
;;  `org-table-dispatch'
;;    Do something with column(s) of org-table at point.
;;  `insert-file-as-org-table'
;;   Insert a file into the current buffer at point, and convert it to an org table.
;;  `org-table-kill-field'
;;    Kill the org-table field under point.
;;  `org-table-copy-field'
;;    Copy the org-table field under point to the kill ring.
;;  `org-table-narrow-column'
;;    Split the current column of an org-mode table to be WIDTH characters wide.
;;  `org-table-narrow'
;;   Narrow the entire org-mode table, apart from FIXEDCOLS, to be within WIDTH characters by adding new rows.
;;  `org-table-fill-empty-cells'
;;   Fill empty cells in current column of org-table at point by splitting non-empty cells above them.
;;  `org-table-query-dimension'
;;   Print and return the number of columns, data lines, cells, hlines, height & width (in chars) of org-table at point.
;;  `org-table-move-cell'
;;   Prompt for a direction and move the current cell in that direction.
;;  `org-table-show-jump-condition'
;;   Display a message in the minibuffer showing the current jump condition.
;;  `org-table-set-jump-condition'
;;   Set the CONDITION for `org-table-jump-condition'.
;;  `org-table-set-jump-direction'
;;   Set the DIRECTION for `org-table-jump-condition'; 'up, 'down, 'left or 'right.
;;  `org-table-jump-next'
;;   Jump to the STEPS next field in the org-table at point matching `org-table-jump-condition'.
;;  `org-table-jump-prev'
;;   Like `org-table-jump-next' but jump STEPS in opposite direction.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below is a list of customizable options:
;;
;;  `org-table-flatten-functions'
;;    Alist of (NAME . FUNCTION) pairs for use with `org-table-flatten-column'.
;;  `org-table-graph-types'
;;    List of graph types for `org-plot/gnuplot'.
;;  `org-table-dispatch-actions'
;;    Actions that can be applied when `org-table-dispatch' is called.
;;  `org-table-filter-function-bindings'
;;    Function bindings (with descriptions) used by `org-table-jump-condition' & `org-dblock-write:tablefilter'.
;;  `org-table-jump-condition-presets'
;;    Named presets for `org-table-jump-condition'.

;;    List of java style date-time matching patterns as accepted by `datetime-matching-regexp' and related functions.
;;  `org-table-timestamp-format'
;;    Default format for timestamps output by `org-table-convert-timestamp'.
;;
;; All of the above can be customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET org-table RET
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put org-table-jb-extras.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

variables have been created, and so can make use of those variables. However functions that use those variables
are not usable in `org-table-jump-condition', and be careful not to shadow any existing functions used by
 `org-table-filter-list'.
These function will only work in a :filter parameter: rowmatch & rowsum
and the functions in the list from field onwards will only work in `org-table-jump-condition' (mostly wrapper 
functions, see the documentation of the functions they wrap for more info)."

  "Filter out rows and columns of a matrix LST represented as a list of lists.

Optional arguments ROWS & COLS are used to indicate which rows and columns to use.
By default all rows/cols are used. The optional FILTER argument is used to filter these selected rows.
Read on for more details.

The ROWS/COLS args may be lists containing a mixture of integers and sublists of 2 or 3 integers.
Individual integers in the list indicate individual rows/columns and sublists indicate ranges.
The `number-sequence' function is applied to sublists to obtain a sequence of integers, e.g. (2 10 2) results
in rows/columns 2, 4, 6, 8, & 10. The integer 0 indicates the final row/column and negative integers count
backward from the last row/column. Integers larger than the largest row/column or smaller than minus that
number indicate the last/first row/column respectively.
So for example \"((1 10) 20 (-9 0))\" selects the first 10 rows/cols, followed by the 20th row/col, followed by
the last 10 rows/cols. If ROWS/COLS is nil then all rows/cols (respectively) are returned.

FILTER should be an sexp that returns non-nil for rows to be included in the output.
It will be mapped over the rows indicated by the ROWS arg, or all rows if this is missing or nil.
The following variables may be used in the sexp:

n       : The number of rows processed so far (e.g: this can be used to limit the amount of output).
c<N>    : The string contained in column <N> of the current row, or nil if it is empty.
c<N>n   : The number contained in column <N> of the current row (using `string-to-number').
row     : A list containing all the items in the current row in order, as strings."

  "Org dynamic block function to filter lines/columns of org tables.

The plist may contain the following parameters:

 :tblnames = the name or ID of the table to filter (quoted),
             or a list of such names/IDs (quoted & surrounded by brackets)
 :rows = a list of integers and ranges (surrounded by brackets) indicating which rows of
         the source table to use (see below for details). If nil then all rows are used.
 :cols = as above but indicating which columns to display in the result. If nil then all columns are displayed.
 :filter = an sexp for filtering the rows to be displayed (see below). If nil then all rows are displayed.
 :noerrors = if non-nil or if placed at the end of the parameter list then any rows which give an error when
             put through the filter will not be displayed. 
 :namescol = if non-nil then an extra column containing the name of the table corresponding to each row
             will be added. By default this new column will be the first column, but if the parameter
             value is last then the new column will be made the last column.

Any of these parameter may be inherited from an org property named :TABLEFILTER: (including :tblnames).
The value of this property should have the same form as the dynamic block parameter list, e.g:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :TABLEFILTER: :cols ((2 -1)) :rows ((1 10)) :namescol last :noerrors :tblnames (\"tbl1\" \"tbl2\")
   :END:
Parameters listed on the dynamic block statement get priority over inherited parameters.

The :rows and :cols arguments should be lists containing a mixture of integers and sublists of 2 or 3 integers.
Individual integers in the list indicate individual rows/columns and sublists indicate ranges.
The `number-sequence' function is applied to sublists to obtain a sequence of integers, e.g. (2 10 2) results
in rows/columns 2, 4, 6, 8, & 10. The integer 0 indicates the final row/column and negative integers count
backward from the last row/column. Integers larger than the largest row/column or smaller than minus that
number indicate the last/first row/column respectively.
So for example \":row ((1 10) 20 (-9 0))\" selects the first 10 rows, followed by the 20th row, followed by
the last 10 rows (and similarly for columns if :cols was used instead of :rows).

The :filter argument should be an sexp that returns non-nil for rows to be included in the output.
It will be mapped over the rows indicated by the :rows arg, or all rows if this is missing or nil.
The following variables may be used in the sexp:

n              : The number of rows processed so far (e.g: this can be used to limit the amount of output).
c<N>           : The string contained in column <N> of the current row.
c<N>n          : The number contained in column <N> of the current row (using `string-to-number').
row            : A list containing all the items in the current row in order, as strings.

Additionally the filter may make use of function bindings in `org-table-filter-function-bindings' (which see).

Some examples now follow.

From the table named \"account\" select all even rows from 2 to 100 inclusive, and columns 1-5 and 10.

#+BEGIN: tablefilter :tblname \"account\" :rows ((2 100 2)) :cols ((1 5) 10)

Select the first 10 rows where the first column is a date within 10 days of today, and the second column
is a number greater than 1000, returning just columns 2 & 3:

#+BEGIN: tablefilter :tblname \"account\" :filter (and (<= n 10) (> (days-to-now c1) -10) (> (num c2) 1000)) :cols (2 3)

Return the rows among the first 100 which match the word \"shopping\" in column 3 (note that c3 is or'ed with \"\" so
that rows in which c3 is empty dont cause an error):

#+BEGIN: tablefilter :tblname \"account\" :filter (string-match \"shopping\" (or c3 \"\")) :rows ((1 100))

  - up/down : move up/down the current column & then to the next column on the left/right
  - left/right move left/right across the current row & then to the next row up/down.

The cdr can be either:

 - 1) A keyword matching an element of `org-table-jump-condition-presets', e.g. :empty
      (called a \"keyword condition\" in the following text).
 - 2) A regexp for matching the contents of the desired cell, e.g. \"foo\".
 - 3) A list containing a regexp followed by one or two numbers indicating the row & column
      offset (relative to the current cell) of the cell to match the regexp against, e.g.
      (\"foo\" 1 1) = cell 1 row above and 1 column to the left of a cell containing \"foo\"
 - 4) A cons cell containing the line & column number to jump to. The car may be any expression
      that evaluates to a number, and the cdr may be a number or symbol that evaluates to a number;
      e.g. (1 . 1) = top-left cell, ((1- numdlines) . numcols) = cell above bottom-right cell
      (note: you can also use the gotocell function described below).
 - 5) An sexp that evaluates to non-nil when the desired cell has been reached; this sexp may contain
      previously mentioned keyword conditions (which will be replaced by their corresponding forms)
      and any of the functions and variables listed below,
      e.g: (and :empty (matchfield \"bar\" 1 0)) = empty cell above a cell containing \"bar\"
 - 6) A list whose first element is either & or | to indicate the logical conjunction/disjunction of
      the subsequent elements. The subsequent elements may include any of the previously mentioned forms
      (keyword condition, regexp, cons cell, sexp) or recursive calls to &/|. For example:
      (& :empty (\"bar\" 1)) = empty cell above cell containing \"bar\"
      (| (& :empty \"bar\" 1) (& :nonempty (\"foo\" 0 -1)) (numdlines . numcols)) = same as previous match,
      but also match non-empty cells to the right of cells containing \"foo\", or the last cell in the table.
 - 7) A list containing the symbol `jmpseq' followed by a sequence of any of the previously mentioned items.
      Each call to `org-table-jump-next' will jump to the next item in this sequence. For example:
      (jmpseq (& :empty \"bar\" 1) (& :nonempty \"foo\" 0 -1) (numdlines . numcols)) = first jump to the next
      empty cell above one containing \"bar\", then jump to the next non-empty cell to the right of one
      containing \"foo\", then jump to the last cell, and repeat.

Each sexp can make use of the functions defined in `org-table-filter-function-bindings' which by default includes
the following functions. Many of these functions have optional ROFFSET & COFFSET args which refer to row & column 
offsets from the current cell, and allow you to act on cells neighbouring the current one. If ROFFSET or COFFSET
is left blank then they default to 0. Also note that cell refers to the position in a table and field to its contents.

 (field &optional ROFFSET COFFSET) = return the field in a cell.
 (matchfield REGEX &optional ROFFSET COFFSET) = call `string-match' with REGEX on a field.
 (setfield VALUE &optional ROFFSET COFFSET NOPROMPT) = change the contents of a cell.
 (replace-in-field REGEXP REP &optional ROFFSET COFFSET) = replace matches to REGEXP with REP in a field.
 (field2num &optional ROFFSET COFFSET) = read a field as a number and return it.
 (changenumber FUNC &optional roffset coffset noprompt) = apply FUNC to the number in a field and replace with the result.
 (flatten NROWS NCOLS FUNC REPS) = a wrapper around `org-table-flatten-columns'.
 (hline-p ROFFSET) = test if the row at ROFFSET rows beneath the current one, counting hlines, is an hline (horizontal line).
 (countcells DIR ROFFSET COFFSET &rest REGEXS) = moving in direction DIR (up/down/left/right) from a given cell offset, 
  return a list containing counts of sequential matches to the 1st regexp, followed by the 2nd regexp, etc.
 (checkcounts COUNTS BOUNDS) = a wrapper around `org-table-check-bounds'.
 (sumcounts DIR ROFFSET COFFSET &rest REGEXS) = similar to countcells but returns total No. of matches.
 (getvar KEY) = get the value associated with KEY in `org-table-jump-state'.
 (setvar KEY VAL) = set the value associated with KEY in `org-table-jump-state' to VAL.
 (checkvar KEY &rest VALS) = return t if value associated with KEY in `org-table-jump-state' is among VALS, and nil otherwise.
 (gotocell LINE &optional COL) = Jump immediately to cell in specified LINE & COL. If either arg is nil use the current line/column.

Be careful with the setfield, replace-in-field, changenum & flatten functions, only use them if your other jump conditions 
are satisfied otherwise you may end up changing more than you want.
getvar, setvar & checkvar are used for communicating state across invocations of `org-table-jump-next', which can be
used for creating more complex jump patterns.
You can also make use of the following variables:

 table = the org-table as a list of lists (as returned by `org-table-to-lisp')
 table-dlines = list of indices of data lines in table
 table-hlines = list of indices of horizontal lines in table
 numdlines = the number of data lines in the table
 numhlines = the number of horizontal lines in the table
 numlines = numdlines + numhlines
 numcols = the number of columns
 currentcol = the current column number
 currentline = the current data line number (i.e. excluding horizontal lines)
 startcol = the column that point was in at the start
 startline = the data line number that point was in at the start
 movedir = the current direction of field traversal ('up,'down,'left or 'right)
 numcells = the total number of cells in the table
 cellcount = the number of cells checked since the last match
 startpos = the position of point before starting.")

;; IDEAS:
;; - table specific jump sequences; stored in #+TBLJMP: footer and loaded automatically by new command `org-table-jump-default'
;;    different conditions/sequences for different prefix keys.
;;    Have an option in org-table-set-jump-condition which selects the table specific jump condition, and a command to save
;;    the current jump condition/sequence to the #+TBLJMP footer.
